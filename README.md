# Wolf-Awesome-Lite
With this tool you can create all the necessary files to use a icon system like with font-awesome.
You can use the compiled exe or the python file.

### How to
Head over to [Icomoon][1]. Once you are on the site click on "Import Icons" on the top and then select all of the icons you would like to use in your custom icon library. Once you are done select all of them and click on "Generate Font" on the lower right corner. You will be brought to a new page and there you can see your icons with a name. Give them a name that is appropriate for example an astronaut icon could be called astronaut. After you are done with that you can see something called "Quick Usage and Sharing". Click on it and you will get the url with html code. Copy ONLY the url part and paste it into the tool to receive all the files in a ready format. You will be left with a css folder and a misc folder. Both are needed for the icons to work.
